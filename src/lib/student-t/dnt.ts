 *    Requires the following auxiliary routines:

 *	pnt(x, df, ncp) - the distribution function for

 *
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 *    From Johnson, Kotz and Balakrishnan (1995) [2nd ed.; formula (31.15), p.516],
 *    the non-central t density is
 *
 *      f(x, df, ncp) =
 *
 *        exp(-.5*ncp^2) * gamma((df+1)/2) / (sqrt(pi*df)* gamma(df/2)) * (df/(df+x^2))^((df+1)/2) *
 *          sum_{j=0}^Inf  gamma((df+j+1)/2)/(factorial(j)* gamma((df+1)/2)) * (x*ncp*sqrt(2)/sqrt(df+x^2))^ j
 *
 *
 *    The functional relationship
 *
 *	   f(x, df, ncp) = df/x *
 *			      (F(sqrt((df+2)/df)*x, df+2, ncp) - F(x, df, ncp))
 *
 *    is used to evaluate the density at x != 0 and
 *
 *	   f(0, df, ncp) = exp(-.5*ncp^2) /
 *				(sqrt(pi)*sqrt(df)*gamma(df/2))*gamma((df+1)/2)
 *
 *    is used for x=0.
 *
 *    All calculations are done on log-scale to increase stability.
 *
 * FIXME: pnt() is known to be inaccurate in the (very) left tail and for ncp > 38
 *       ==> use a direct log-space summation formula in that case
