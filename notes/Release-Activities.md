This is the list of release activities needed for every TypeScript release.
[Additional activities](#additional-activities) are also needed if a new syntax is introduced or a new compiler option gets added.

The primary people managing a release should oversee these tasks along with the [overall release process](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript's-Release-Process).

## Release Candidate Activities

### tslib

* [ ] Add all tslib updates
* [ ] Review next version number

### `@definitelytyped/header-parser` and `retag`

Once `main`'s version is updated, the @definitelytyped packages must be aware of the nightly's new version so that nightly versions of ATA continue to work. ATA relies on `tsX.Y` tags on `@types/*` packages.

* [ ] Update [@definitelytyped/typescript-versions](https://github.com/Microsoft/DefinitelyTyped-tools/tree/master/packages/typescript-versions) to support ***the next version***, and publish a new release.
    * in other words, if we're releasing TypeScript 3.9, the header parser needs to support `4.0`.
